This repository includes 8 SQL Case study hosted by Danny Ma which includes different datasets and multiple realistic end to end case studies that closely represent the sort of work we perform in a data analytics role.

The 8 Week SQL Challenge is inspired by the [Data With Danny](https://bit.ly/datawithdanny-8wsc) virtual data apprenticeship program to celebrate the launch of his Serious SQL course! The SQL Challenge could be found [Here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/getting-started/)

In this case study, Danny owns a resaurant called Danny's Diner. Danny’s Diner is in need of assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

## Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program — additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues — but he hopes that these examples are enough for me to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!
